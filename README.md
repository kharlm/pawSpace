pawSpace is an app written in React Native that allows users to post their dogs and share content about them including their name, breed, gender and an individual story about their dog. The app will be a a mix between instagram and facebook but purely for dogs. The user will be encapsulated from the dogs and no information about the user will be posted, instead each user will have the capability to have multiple dog profiles where each dog will be identified by a unique identifier known as a "dogTag" instead of a username. Users will have the abilities to follow other dogs like their pictures and posts using a feature known as a "lick" instead of liking and have the ability to message and greet with other dog owners. Users will have multiple tabs, the first being a home screen which will first be populated with the profile of a dog that wants to be adopted in your area based on your current zip code, you will also see local dog parks and essentials dog services in your area such as pet stores, vets and local dog groomers.The user will also have a tab to view other dogs in the area and decide whether they like or dislike that dog and if both dogs like each other they will match and will be able to setup a play date(a tinder like system). The next tab will be a map of the world where the user can click in any major city and see all the dogs and their posts from that city. The last tab will be of the dog profile itself which will feature the dog name, the dogTag, breed, gender, age, bio and other information about the dog.
